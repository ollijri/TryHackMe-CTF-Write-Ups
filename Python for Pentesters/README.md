## Subdomain Enumeration 

Before you begin, its best to use 'pip' to install the module 'requests' as it is used in the questions but missing from the latest version of python (as of writing) if using your own PC. To do that enter the following into cmd/terminal:
  <p></p>
  
``` pip install requests ```

<summary> What other protocol could be used for subdomain enumeration? </summary>
<p></p>
  
  Domain Name Servers can have public-facing subdomains that can prove useful. The website https://dnsdumpster.com/ is a perfect example of this. Using the tryhackme website as an example search, this website can provide a basic domain map exposing a few (but not for certain all) subdomains attached to this address.

 ```Answer = dns ```

  'sys.argv' contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.

## Directory Enumeration 

<details>
<summary> How many directories can your script identify on the target system? (extensions are .html) </summary>
  <p></p>
  When downloading the task file, you'll need to change it to 'wordlist.txt' rather than 'wordlist2.txt' or it will not work. Then after the code is copied and run in CMD you should see the following:

  ``` Answer = 4 ```

<summary>What is the location of the login page?</summary>
  <p></p>
Either by trying all 4 directories, or from guessing by the name, you can work out that "/private.html" holds the login page as seen below:
