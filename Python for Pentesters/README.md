## Subdomain Enumeration 

Before you begin, its best to use 'pip' to install the modules 'requests' and 'scapy' as they are used in the questions but missing from the latest version of python (as of writing) if using your own PC. To do that enter the following into cmd/terminal:
  <p></p>
  
``` pip install requests ```
``` pip install scapy ```
``` pip install pyfiglet ```

<details>
<summary> What other protocol could be used for subdomain enumeration? </summary>
<p></p>
  
  Domain Name Servers can have public-facing subdomains that can prove useful. The website https://dnsdumpster.com/ is a perfect example of this. Using the tryhackme website as an example search, this website can provide a basic domain map exposing a few (but not for certain all) subdomains attached to this address.
