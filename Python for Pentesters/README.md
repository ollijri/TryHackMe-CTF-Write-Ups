## Subdomain Enumeration 

Before you begin, its best to use 'pip' to install the modules below as they are used in the questions but missing from the latest version of python (as of writing) if using your own PC. Enter the following into cmd/terminal:
  <p></p>
  
``` pip install requests ```
``` pip install scapy ```
``` pip install pyfiglet ```

<details>
<summary> What other protocol could be used for subdomain enumeration? </summary>
<p></p>
  
  Domain Name Servers can have public-facing subdomains that can prove useful. The website https://dnsdumpster.com/ is a perfect example of this. Using the tryhackme website as an example search, this website can provide a basic domain map exposing a few (but not for certain all) subdomains attached to this address.

## Directory Enumeration 

<details>
<summary> How many directories can your script identify on the target system? (extensions are .html) </summary>
  <p></p>
  When downloading the task file, you'll need to change it to 'wordlist.txt' rather than 'wordlist2.txt' or it will not work. Then after the code is copied and run in CMD you should see the following:
  <p></p>

  ``` Answer = 4 ```

</details>

<details>
<summary> What is the location of the login page? </summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary> Which variable would you need to change according to your local IP block? </summary>

<details>
<summary> What variable would you change to run this code on a system with the network interface named ens33? </summary>
  <p></p>
  
  ``` Answer = interface ```

</details>

## Port Scanner

<details>
<summary> What protocol will most likely be using TCP port 22? </summary>

SSH uses port 22
  <p></p>
  
``` Answer = ssh ```

</details>

<details>
<summary> What module did we import to be able to use sockets?  </summary>
  <p></p>
  
``` Answer = socket ```

</details>

<details>
<summary> What function is likely to fail if we didn't import sys? </summary>

<details>
<summary> What step of the Unified Cyber Kill Chain can PSexec be used in? </summary>
<p></p>
To begin with, some definitions:
  <p></p>

  <li> PsExec is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems. </ul>
  <li> The Unified Kill Chains provides insight into the tactics that hackers employ to attain objectives in cyber attacks. </ul>
  </li></li>
  
  <p></p>
  
  More information on the Unified Cyber Kill Chain here --> https://warnerchad.medium.com/unified-kill-chain-in-cyber-threat-intelligence-b577bf340ceb
  
  There are 18 steps to the Cyber Kill Chain. As PsExec cis a telnet replacement, it would make sense for it to be used in the "Lateral Movement" phase as it can be used to control and execute on other systems with full interactivity.
    
``` Answer = Lateral Movement ```

## Hash Cracker

<details>
<summary> What is the hash you found during directory enumeration? </summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary> What is the cleartext value of this hash? </summary>
  <p></p>
Still using the same wordlist as earlier, when the program is run enter the exact location of the wordlist followed by the hash (as seen below) to get the answer.
  <p></p>
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66912443/185484289-2c68be94-6179-40b7-a61a-7e18a0c09240.png)

<details>
<summary> Modify the script to work with SHA256 hashes. </summary>
  <p></p>
To make this work you literally need to modify a single line from this:
  <p></p>
  
  ```hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())```
  <p></p>
  To This:
  <p></p>
  
  ```hash_ob = hashlib.sha256(line.strip().encode())```
  
</details>

<details>
<summary> Using the modified script find the cleartext value for 5030c5bd002de8713fef5daebd597620f5e8bcea31c603dccdfcdf502a57cc60 </summary>
<p></p>
Still using the same wordlist again, when the program is run enter the exact location of the wordlist followed by the new hash (as seen below) to get the answer.
